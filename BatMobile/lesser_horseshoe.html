    <h2>General </h2>
    <p>In the summer lesser horseshoe bats emerge about half an hour 
after sunset. The emergence follows a period when the bats fly 
around within the roost with some appearing outside the roost 
entrance; presumably they are testing the conditions outside 
before emergence. Although there are peaks of activity at dusk 
and dawn bats are active all night throughout the breeding season. 
Lesser horseshoe bats are sensitive to disturbance and twist their 
bodies as they scan their surroundings before flying off.  </p>
	<p> Lesseresser horseshoe bats feed amongst vegetation in sheltered horseshoe bats feed amongst vegetation in sheltered 
lowland valleys. They rarely fly more than five metres above 
the ground, frequently circling over favoured areas and often 
gleaning their prey from branches. Large prey is often taken 
back to a temporary night roost or sometimes dealt with whilst 
the bat is hanging in trees. Feeding remains are often found in 
these temporary night roosts, particularly in porches and the 
entrance to tunnels. </p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p> Lesser horseshoe bats were originally cave dwellers, but summer 
colonies are now usually found in the roofs of larger rural houses 
and stable blocks offering a range of roof spaces and a nearby 
cellar, cave or tunnel where the bats can go torpid in inclement 
weather. They prefer access through an opening that allows 
uninterrupted flight to the roof apex but are capable of using 
more inconspicuous gaps. The colony may shift between attics, 
cellars and chimneys throughout the summer, depending on the 
weather. The whole colony may form a dense cluster, especially 
in cooler weather during lactation but if the roost gets very hot 
individuals hang spaced slightly apart</p>
    <p>Lesseresser horseshoe bats hibernate from September/October until horseshoe bats hibernate from September/October until 
April and frequently into May, using caves, mines, tunnels and 
cellars. Lesser horseshoe bats are often active in hibernacula in 
autumn and spring, especially towards dusk in warm weather, 
when feeding is more likely to be successful. They appear to 
select places with similar temperatures to those sought by 
greater horseshoe bats, preferring temperatures of up to 11ÂºC 
and high humidity. Males tend to arrive earlier than females and 
are often more numerous. Many sites only have one or a few bats 
hibernating in them and it is rare to find large numbers in a site. 
Lesser horseshoe bats do not cluster together but hang a little 
apart form their neighbours, usually in exposed situations, but 
General
sometimes in open crevices. They may be found at any height, 
venturing much further into underground sites than other bats. </p>
    
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p> Flies (mainly midges), small moths, caddis flies, lacewings, 
beetles, small wasps and spiders.</p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>Mating takes place during autumn, sometimes later in winter. 
Maternity roosts are almost always formed in buildings and 
may be occupied from April, though most breeding females do 
not arrive until May. Maternity colonies of the lesser horseshoe 
bat are mixed-sex, with up to a fifth of the colony being male. 
Approximately half to two-thirds of the females in the nursery 
roost give birth to a single young between mid-June and midJuly</p>
<p>Lactation probably lasts four to five weeks, by which time the 
young can fly from the roost. Young are completely independent 
at six weeks. Most young are sexually mature in their second 
autumn</p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p>Lesser horseshoe bats have an almost constant frequency call, 
about 110kHz. On a bat detector a series of continuous warbles 
can be heard. </p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="lesser_horseshoe_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p>This species has shown a marked 
decline in numbers and distribution, 
although there is evidence of a 
recent increase in Wales. The lesser 
horseshoe bat is rare in the British 
Isles and is confined to Wales, western 
England and western Ireland.</p>
<p>The decline of the lesser horseshoe 
bat is attributable to several factors, 
including disturbance to roosts and 
intensive agricultural practices. 
Lesser horseshoe bats are particularly 
sensitive to disturbance, especially in their nursery and winter 
roosts, and these sites need specific protection. Sensitive 
management of their foraging habitats is very important.</p>
