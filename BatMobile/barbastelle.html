    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img alt="barbastelle" src="barbastelle.jpg" id="bat-image">
    <p> The barbastelle is a medium-sized bat, distinctive by its pug-shaped
      nose. The ears are broad, joined across its head by skin, and covered in
      gingery-brown fur on the rear surface. The tragus is triangular – broad at
      the base but with a nearly parallel tip which starts about halfway along
      its length. </p>

    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> Barbastelle bats tend to forage over a wide area. They are fast, agile
      flyers and specialist foragers in a range of habitats, swooping to drink
      from ponds or lakes. In summer they often emerge early from their daytime
      roosts to forage in the dark zone amongst trees until open area light
      levels have fallen to those existing under tree canopies; then they may
      forage in quite open areas. </p>
    <p>Being one of the rarest mammals, much remains to be learned about
      barbastelles. Their UK range is currently thought to extend mainly over
      southern and central England and Wales but the information contained in
      this leaflet may change as further roosts are discovered and research is
      undertaken.</p>
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p> In mainland Europe nursery colonies have been found in building crevices
      but in England roosts have also been located in cracks in trees in areas
      of high humidity. Once the young can fly it seems that the colony may
      sometimes divide into smaller units and then reconvene at a single roost
      in late July – sometimes in one of the roosts used before the young were
      born. </p>
    <p>The majority of UK winter records are of single bats in underground
      sites. Barbastelles are relatively tolerant of the cold, and are found in
      caves, tunnels, cellars and trees in mainland Europe. They often hibernate
      in relatively exposed situations. In the UK they are also known to roost
      in cavities behind joints of timber-framed buildings, between close
      fitting roof timbers and in hollow tree trunks. Occasionally they can be
      found behind loose bark on dead trees, and movement between winter roosts
      is quite frequent they have been known to fly and forage in mild spells
      all winter. </p>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p> Mainly small moths, some flies and beetles. </p>
    <h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
    <p> Little information is available on the mating of Barbastelles. It seems
      take place in small gatherings at the end of the nursery roost period,
      with one sexually active male attended by up to six females some
      accompanied by their young. They may also mate in hibernacula. Females
      usually reach sexual maturity in their second year, although they have
      been known to mate in their first. Nursery roosts seem to be relatively
      small, with only 10-20 females plus babies in mainland Europe roosts may
      rarely consist of up to 100 bats. Baby bats are usually born in July,
      sometimes even in early August; females usually produce a single baby, but
      occasionally twins. Juvenile bats can fly at about 3 weeks, and by 6 weeks
      can forage for themselves. Research indicates that juveniles follow the
      adults into their established foraging areas. During the nursery roosting
      time males tend to live a solitary existence. </p>
    <h2>Echolocation</h2>
    <p> Their echolocation can best be heard at approximately 32 kHz. Their
      calls sound like short, hard smacks, in fast and then slower pulses. </p>
    <h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
    <img alt="distribution" src="barbastelle_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
    <p> The barbastelle is very rare, found in southern and central England and
      Wales. Very few breeding sites are currently known in the UK and it is
      important that surrounding environments of these and winter hibernation
      sites are maintained. It is thought that they prefer pastoral landscapes
      with deciduous woodland, wet meadows and water bodies, such as woodland
      streams and rivers. </p>
    <p>The extensive loss of deciduous woodland in the UK may be a significant
      factor in the rarity of this species. Use of artificial fertilisers and
      pesticides reduces insect diversity and may lead to indirect poisoning of
      bats, and pesticide run-off in water can severely disrupt aquatic insect
      abundance. Bats foraging over wet meadows mostly prey on micromoths,
      therefore measures to improve the quality of water meadows for the benefit
      of micromoths will provide better foraging opportunities for barbastelles.
    </p>
    <p>The barbastelle is a UK Biodiversity Action Plan species, which means
      that it is a conservation priority on both a local and national scale.</p>
