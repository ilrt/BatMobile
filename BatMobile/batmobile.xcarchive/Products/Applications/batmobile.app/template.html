    <p>	Whiskered bat is very similar to Brandt’s bat and the two species were only separated Whiskered bat is very similar to Brandt’s bat and the two species were only separated 
in 1970. Both are small species with somewhat shaggy fur – Brandt’s bat is slightly 
larger than whiskered bat. The two species are most reliably separated by differences larger than whiskered bat. The two species are most reliably separated by differences 
in dentition and penis shape. Other distinguishing features are thought to include 
tragus shape and claw length.</p>

    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> Whiskered bats emerge within half an hour of sunset and 
probably remain active throughout much of the night. They 
have a fast and fluttering flight, to a height of 20 metres, 
generally level with occasional swoops. They glide briefly, 
especially when feeding in the canopy. They frequently 
fly along a regular route over or alongside a hedgerow or 
woodland edge. </p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p>Whiskered bats are regularly found in buildings, though 
colonies are more commonly found in the north and west. 
They are found in all types of houses including some 
modern ones, but particularly in older buildings with stone 
walls and slate roofs. It is a crevice dweller, often roosting 
until hanging tiles, above soffits, in cavity walls and under 
ridge tiles. </p>
    <p>Droppings frequently accumulate in the roof below the 
ridge and especially below the favoured roost sites, but 
not particularly at gable ends or on chimneys. Colonies 
of whiskered and Brandt’s bats may use separate parts of 
the same roof and may also roost with pipistrelles or longeared bats. They do roost in trees and churches, and have 
been known to use bat boxes.</p>
	<p>In winter whiskered bats are regularly found hibernating 
in caves and tunnels, almost always in small numbers – it 
is uncertain where the majority of them hibernate. They 
are usually found in cold areas close to the entrance, but 
occasionally roost in the warmer interior. They may choose 
more humid conditions than Brandt’s bat, and more often 
hang exposed. Males may stay at the hibernation sites until 
well into May.</p>
    
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Moths, other small insects and spiders. Studies have 
indicated that whiskered bats have more flexible foraging 
General
habits than Brandt’s bats </p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>Mating usually takes place in autumn, but has been observed 
in all winter months. Adult females form maternity colonies 
in the summer, giving birth to their single young in June 
or early July. The baby is fed solely on its mother’s milk: 
by three weeks it can fly and by six weeks it can forage for 
itself. </p>
<p>Some females reach sexual maturity at three months (in 
their first autumn) but the majority do not mate until their 
second autumn.  </p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p>Whiskered bats echolocate between 32kHz and 89kHz, 
sounding loudest at 45kHz. Their calls sound like dry 
clicks (similar to Daubenton’s but not as regular and often 
slower); they are sometimes mistaken for pipistrelles but 
their frequency range is much wider </p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="whiskered_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p>Whiskered bat is thought to 
be slightly more common and 
widespread than Brandt’s bat. 
It is found throughout England 
and Wales and even in southern 
Scotland and throughout Ireland.</p>
<p>They are vulnerable to the effects 
of modern agricultural practices 
and decline of woodland, which 
result in loss of suitable feeding 
habitats and hollow trees for 
roosting. They are susceptible to pesticides, especially those 
used as remedial timber treatment chemicals. Disturbance 
and vandalism of their hibernation sites (caves and tunnels) 
is an additional threat.</p>
