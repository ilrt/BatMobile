    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img  src="greater_horseshoe.jpg" id="bat-image">
    <p>The horseshoe bats can be distinguished from other British bats by the presence of a complex 
horseshoe-shaped noseleaf which is related to their particular type of echolocation system. 
When roosting they hang free with the wings more or less enfolding their body. 
The greater horseshoe bat is one of our largest bat species, the size of a small pear. The greater horseshoe bat is one of our largest bat species, the size of a small pear.	</p>

    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> Greater horseshoe bats emerge from their roosts within half an 
hour of sunset. Between May and August they usually return 
to their roosts after about an hour and remain there until their 
second feed around dawn. However, from late August they may 
remain away all night. </p>
<p>Insects are taken in flight or occasionally from the ground. 
Greater horseshoe bats often behave like flycatchers, 'watching'
from a regular perch and flying out to take passing insects. Large 
prey is taken to a regular feeding perch; insect remains beneath 
such perches in trees, porches or cave entrances are most evident 
in spring or autumn. Greater horseshoe bats feed mainly by lowflying hunting.</p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p>Greater horseshoes bats were originally cave dwellers, but few 
now use caves in summer - most breeding females use buildings, 
choosing sites with large entrance holes with access to open roof 
spaces warmed by the sun. Such sites are normally in larger, 
older houses, churches and barns. A range of other sites is used in 
spring, and males hold territory at maternity roosts in autumn.  </p>
    <p>Maternity colonies can be noisy, with continuous chattering, 
chirping and scolding calls. Males also use caves and tunnels 
in the summer and even the breeding females appear to need a 
nearby cave or tunnel to retreat to when bad weather affects their 
food supply.</p>
<p>In winter the greater horseshoe bat uses caves, disused mines,
cellars and tunnels as hibernation sites. These sites can be up to 
50km from the breeding roost. The bats wake from hibernation at 
frequent intervals and, in their search for suitable temperatures, 
movements of 30km between sites have been recorded. The 
bats will sometimes form clusters in winter sites, although adult 
females are more solitary.</p>
    
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Chafers, dung beetles, noctuid moths, craneflies and caddis 
flies </p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>Mating occurs mainly during the autumn, but can take place in 
late winter or even spring. Maternity colonies begin to gather 
in May and reach peak numbers in mid-June to July when most 
breeding females return to the maternity roost. Some males 
return with breeding females in June, but most leave when the 
young are born in mid-July.</p>
<p>Female greater horseshoe bats are not usually sexually mature 
until their third year and one known female did not breed until 
its tenth year. They may not breed every year.
Greater horseshoe bats have been known to live for up to 30 
years.</p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p> Greater horseshoe bats have an almost constant frequency call 
of about 82kHz. On a bat detector a series of continuous warbles 
can be heard.</p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="greater_horseshoe_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p>The greater horseshoe bat has 
shown a marked decline. It is rare in 
Britain and now confined to southwest England and south Wales. It is 
estimated that the number of greater 
horseshoe bats has declined by over 
90% in the last 100 years.</p>
<p>The decline of the greater horseshoe 
bat may be due to factors such as 
disturbance of roosts and intensive 
agricultural practices including loss 
of permanent pasture. These bats are particularly sensitive to 
disturbance at their nursery and winter roosts. Those sites need to 
be specifically protected and entrance holes left unobstructed.</p>
<p>The conservation of the species feeding habitats and food sources 
is also important. The use of pesticides has led to a decrease in 
availability of larger beetles, particularly cockchafers, and moths 
over large areas of the countryside.</p>
