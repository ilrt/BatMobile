    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> Noctules have a characteristic powerful, direct flight on narrow 
pointed wings.They fly in the open, often well above tree-top 
level, with repeated steep dives when chasing insects. Noctule 
bats can fly at 50 kph.  </p>
	<p> Mostos food is caught on the wing and eaten in flight but food is caught on the wing and eaten in flight but 
occasionally prey is taken from the ground and in suburban 
areas noctules are attracted to street lamps to feed on moths. 
During spring noctules will feed mainly on smaller insects such 
as midges, changing their diet to take beetles and moths later in 
the season. They forage mainly at dusk for up to two hours and 
for about half an hour at dawn. They are known to fly over 10km 
from roost to feeding areas. </p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p>Noctule bats are primarily tree dwellers and live mainly in rot 
holes and woodpecker holes. They occur rarely in buildings; 
most noctule roosts in buildings are only gathering roosts, the 
colonies moving off at the end of May and early June. The bats 
produce loud characteristic metallic chirping sounds so that 
noctule colonies can be heard up to 200-300m away on hot 
days. </p>
    <p>Noctule bats hibernate mainly in trees or rock fissures and 
hollows, but have also been found in bat boxes, buildings and 
other man-made structures in winter. They sometimes form 
large mixed-sex winter aggregations of up to 1,000 on mainland 
Europe, but the group sizes are smaller in the UK. Noctules have 
been observed feeding at any time in winter if conditions are 
suitable but most can survive successfully without feeding for 
nearly four months and can tolerate external temperatures as low 
as -7°C.</p>
    
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Moths, beetles (mainly chafer and dung beetles), mayflies and 
winged ants. </p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p> During the summer, male noctules are solitary or form small 
bachelor groups. A single male establishes a mating roost during 
late summer, usually in a tree hole, staying for several weeks and 
defending his roost against other sexually mature males. </p>
<p> He emits a series of shrill mating calls from the roost entrance 
or during flight and produces a strong odour, attracting a harem 
usually of four or five (but up to 20) females, which stay with the 
male for 1 or 2 days. </p>
<p> In April noctule bats begin to form mixed-sex colonies and can 
be found in tree holes, buildings and bat boxes. Such colonies 
often break up in late spring and smaller maternity colonies are 
found in trees, rarely in buildings and bridges. The young are 
born in late June or July. Females usually have one young, but 
twins are sometimes recorded. For 3 to 4 weeks the young are 
suckled solely on their mother’s milk, and they are fully weaned 
and able to forage for themselves within 6 weeks.  </p>
<p>The maternity colonies frequently change roosts, mothers 
carrying the smaller young between roosts during lactation. The 
young are left in crèches while the mothers go off to feed. Some 
females become sexually mature in their first autumn but many 
do not mate until their second year. Males participate in mating 
from the end of their first year.</p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p>Noctules’ calls can be heard by some adults and children. The 
calls range from 20 to 45kHz and peak at 25kHz. On a bat 
detector a characteristic ‘chip chop’ with occasional clicks can 
be heard during feeding. </p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="noctule_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p> The noctule is still a relatively 
widespread species in much of 
England, Wales and to south-west 
Scotland, but has become scarce in 
some areas of intensive agriculture. 
The noctule is absent from Ireland. </p>
<p> The noctule bat has declined in 
Britain, owing to modern intensive 
agricultural practices resulting in 
the loss of suitable feeding habitat 
such as permanent pasture and 
woodland edge/hedgerows rich in invertebrate fauna. Intensive 
management and loss of suitable trees for roosting is a major 
factor. </p>
