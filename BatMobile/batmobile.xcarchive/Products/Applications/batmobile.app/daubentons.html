    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> Daubenton’s bats usually feed within about 6km of the roost, but 
have been recorded following canals for up to 10km (at speeds 
of up to 25kph). They usually take insects from close to the water 
and have even been seen taking prey directly from the water 
surface, using their large feet as a gaff or the tail membrane as 
a scoop. </p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p>In England and Wales, the majority of known summer colonies 
are in humid, more or less underground sites near water. 
These may be tunnels or bridges over canals and rivers, or in 
caves, mines and cellars. They are only occasionally found in 
buildings, usually old stone structures such as moated castles 
and waterworks. In Scotland, colonies more frequently occur 
in buildings. Tree-holes are probably much more widely used 
than the recorded evidence suggests and one individual was 
even observed entering a small hole in an earthen roadside bank. 
They have also bred in bat boxes. Summer colonies are often 
quite noisy throughout the day, especially at sites where they 
are close to human activity. A variety of temporary night roosts 
are used, often in trees or tunnels close to the feeding sites. 
Daubenton’s bats have been found clustering with pipistrelle, 
noctule, Natterer’s and brown long-eared bats </p>
    <p>Many Daubenton’s bats hibernate in caves, mines and other 
underground sites. In extensive tunnel systems with large 
numbers of bats present, Daubenton’s are often the most 
numerous species. They enter these winter sites in October, 
but only small numbers are present in the early part of winter. 
Numbers can increase dramatically towards the end of January 
and February, and individuals often remain at these sites until 
the end of March or even early April. Most are found in the 
warmer more stable environment within a site, although they 
can be found close to the entrance, particularly later in winter. 
Although usually solitary, small groups of three or four are not 
uncommon. Individuals are often lodged in tight crevices; many 
are barely visible in such conditions and it is likely that others 
are not visible at all. Daubenton’s bats may also hide among 
rocks and scree on the floor of caves and tunnels making finding 
them very difficult; it is likely that the numbers counted in many 
sites are a considerable underestimate of the numbers actually 
present.</p>
    
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Small flies (especially chironomid midges), caddisflies and 
mayflies. </p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>Mating takes place in the autumn and active males will continue 
to seek out and mate with females throughout the winter. 
Maternity roosts are occupied from late spring and sometimes 
until October. Young bats are suckled for several weeks and are 
fully weaned and able to forage for themselves at 6 to 8 weeks. 
Males or non-breeding females may aggregate during the 
summer to form their own communal roosts, but sometimes join 
maternity colonies. The average colony size is between 20 to 50 
bats (up to 200). Daubenton’s bats can live for up to 22 years.</p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p> Daubenton’s bat calls range from 35 to 85kHz and are loudest at 
45 to 50kHz. On a bat detector the calls are heard as a machinegun like series of regular clicks for bursts of 5 to 10 seconds.</p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="daubentons_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p>Daubenton’s bat is fairly widespread 
up to northern Scotland, in Ireland 
and on the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>Despite severe loss of and damage 
to wetlands and waterways, 
Daubenton’s bat seems to be 
increasing in parts of its range. 
This may in part be associated with 
the increasing number of artificial 
water bodies, including gravel pits, 
reservoirs and flooded quarries. Also 
a low level of pollution may encourage a more consistent supply 
of certain insects.
</p>
<p>
However, the loss of diversity of aquatic insects has a detrimental 
effect on other animals and without very careful pollution 
controls would also affect Daubenton’s bats. The removal of 
waterside trees and disturbance to hibernation sites could also 
lead to a decline in this species.
