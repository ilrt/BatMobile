    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> Most of the food is caught within 2km of the roost although 
serotines may forage up to six kilometres. Having caught a large 
beetle, a serotine will fly around slowly, chewing its prey and 
dropping the wing cases and legs; sometimes it will take the prey 
to a feeding perch. </p>
<p>It flies at about tree-top height (to about 10 m) often close to flies at about tree-top height (to about 10 m) often close to 
vegetation, and will sometimes flop, wings outstretched, on to 
the foliage to catch large insects. The serotine will feed around 
street lamps and even catch prey from the ground.</p>

   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p>Serotines roost mainly in buildings with high gables and cavity 
walls. They can be found in much older buildings and churches, 
but are less often found in modern buildings. The access to the 
roost is usually at or near the gable apex or the lower eaves. 
The serotine is one of the most building-oriented species and is 
hardly ever found in trees </p>
    <p> They roost hidden in crevices around chimneys, in cavity 
walls, between felt or boarding and tiles or slates, beneath 
floorboards and sometimes in the open roof space at the ridge 
ends or occasionally elsewhere along the ridge. Droppings 
are often present in large amounts at gable ends or around a 
chimney base, although some long-established colonies show no 
obvious signs of occupation where the roost is in a cavity wall. 
The point of access is not well-marked, though sometimes it is 
slightly discoloured and there are likely to be a few droppings 
underneath. </p>
	<p> Serotines sometimes roost in the same building as pipistrelles 
or long-eared bats, and they have also been known to associate 
with natterer’s, whiskered and noctule bats </p>
	<p> Very few serotines are found in winter, but it is likely that most 
hibernate in buildings. It is possible that at least part of the 
summer colony may remain in the same building for some, if not 
all, of the winter period. Hibernating serotines have been found 
inside cavity walls and disused chimneys. Very rarely they have 
been found in the coldest parts of caves, either in roof crevices 
or in accumulations of boulders. </p>    
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p> In spring, mainly flies and moths; in summer, particularly chafers 
and dung beetles.</p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>Maternity colonies consist almost exclusively of female bats and 
start to build up in May. Numbers in smaller maternity colonies 
are often stable from the end of May. A colony usually remains 
at a single roost site during the breeding season, although larger 
colonies sometimes change roosts. Females normally give birth 
to a single young in early July, though births as late as midAugust have been recorded. The baby is occasionally carried 
by its mother for the first few days. At 3 weeks the young are 
able to make their first flight and at 6 weeks they can forage for 
themselves. The colony usually disperses by early September, 
but a few bats may remain in the roost until early October.</p>
<p>The males probably remain solitary or in small groups but are 
occasionally found with females in spring or autumn. Mating 
normally takes place in the autumn, but almost nothing is 
known of the mating behaviour. M</p>

The males probably remain solitary or in small groups but are

normally takes place in the autumn, but almost nothing is 
known of the mating behaviour. Males and females reach sexual 
maturity a year after their birth.
