    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img  src="grey_long_eared.jpg" id="bat-image">
    <p>	Grey long-eared bats are very rare medium sized bats found only in a few places in southern 
England. It can be very difficult to distinguish the rare grey long-eared from the more common 
brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus).</p>

    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> A grey long-eared bat’s ears are nearly as long as the body, but 
are not always obvious; when at rest they curl their ears back 
like rams horns, or tuck them away completely under their wings 
leaving only the pointed inner lobe of the ear (the tragus) 
visible </p>
<p>The most reliable distinguishing features between brown and 
grey long-eared bats are dorsal hair colour (dark and light bands 
along the hairs in the brown long-eared), the length of the thumb, 
the ratio of the length of the thumb to the length of the forearm, 
the width of the tragus, and face colour (pinkish- brown in the 
brown long-eared bat) and shape (grey long-eared bats have a 
longer and darker muzzle).</p>
<p>Since the northern edge of the grey long-eared bat’s distribution 
is 53°N, bats found above this latitude are more than likely brown 
long-eared bats, which are far more common and widespread in 
Britain.</p>

   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p>Relatively little is known about the habitat use of the grey longeared bat. Recent radio-tracking studies show that they tend to 
forage over meadows, grasslands, gardens and near forest edges, 
up to 6 km away from the roost.  </p>
    <pLong-eared bats are most often found in older houses with large 
open roof voids which allow the bats to fly around in the roof. 
Bats can be found in these roosts throughout the year, though 
numbers are higher in the summer. As well as using the roof 
void, the bats will tuck themselves away behind rafters, so they 
may not always be seen. A favourite roosting place is on or 
above the ridge beam of the roof and a line of droppings beneath 
is often a good indication of their presence.></p>
<p>In winter, long-eared bats may still be found in roofs in small 
numbers and some are seen in underground sites such as caves, 
mines and cellars</p>
    
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Moths, Diptera (mainly Tipulids – crane flies), small beetles </p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>As with other species, long-eared breeding colonies gather in 
roosts during April and May. Generally numbers are quite low, 
averaging about 20 adults, but colonies of up to 100 are known. 
Males are often found in these roosts and are obviously tolerated 
by the females. The single baby is born in the end of June/
beginning of July and is able to fly by August.</p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p> This species emerges in darkness and, like the brown long-eared,
is a very skilful flier. Although the two species have similar wing 
morphology however, the grey long-eared bat mainly forages in 
open spaces and catches prey in flight, while the brown longeared bat mainly forages in woodlands and gleans prey from the 
vegetation. The echolocation pulses produced by these bats are 
very quiet - this is thought to help with finding insects on foliage 
as well as to avoid warning moths of the presence of the bat. 
Call duration: 1.7ms, Minimum frequency: 29.8kHz, Maximum 
frequency: 62.5kHz</p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src=".jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p>The grey long-eared bat is a southern 
European species, with a distribution 
extending from the northern 
Mediterranean coast in the south to 
southwest England and the Black 
Sea coast in the north (up to latitude 
53ºN). In England, grey long-eareds 
are restricted to a few colonies in 
Sussex, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, 
Dorset, Devon and Somerset</p>
<p>Although grey long-eareds are 
widespread in southern Europe and have a Lower Risk Least 
Concerned global conservation status (IUCN Red List 2009), it 
is extremely rare in countries at the northern edge of its range.</p>
<p>There are no specific conservation management plans for the 
grey long-eared bat in Britain, despite this species rarity, partly 
due to a lack of information on its behaviour and ecological 
requirements in Britain.</p>
