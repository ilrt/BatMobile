    <p>	Nathusius pipistrelle is a rare bat in the UK, though records have increased in recent years. It Nathusius’ pipistrelle is a rare bat in the UK, though records have increased in recent years. It 
is a migratory species, and most bats are encountered in autumn, although some do remain all 
year and breed in the UK. It is similar in appearance to, but slightly larger than the much more 
commonly found common and soprano pipistrelles, and the fur on its back is longer, sometimes 
giving a shaggy appearance. </p>

    <h2>General </h2>
    <p>Nathusius’ pipistrelle was first recorded in Great Britain in the 
Shetland Islands in 1940. It was initially regarded as a vagrant, 
but its status was subsequently upgraded to winter visiting 
migrant as records accumulated, and since the 1990s it has been 
known to breed in the UK. A small number of maternity colonies 
are known both in England and Northern Ireland  </p>
	<p> In continental Europe, Nathusius’ pipistrelle migrates south 
west across Europe in late autumn and winter before returning to 
eastern Europe the following spring. In the UK it appears that a 
small summer breeding population is supplemented by migratory 
individuals during the winter. </p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p> Nathusius’ pipistrelles are often recorded roosting in crevices 
and have been found in cracks in walls, under soffit boards, 
fissures in rocks and tree hollows. </p>
    <p>In the UK only a small number of maternity colonies have been 
reported and these have been in the walls of traditionally-built 
buildings of stone and red brick, in wall cavities and under 
flat roofs. Maternity roosts are frequently shared with soprano 
pipistrelles.</p>
    <p>The majority of roosts are located close to large freshwater 
lakes, and this species also forages near rivers, canals, lakes and 
waterlogged areas, as well as in woodland rides and edges. The 
flight is rapid – slightly faster than that of common and soprano 
pipistrelles, although it is not quite as manoeuvrable, and its 
insect prey are caught on the wing, by ‘aerial hawking’. </p>
	<p>No significant hibernation sites reported for this species in 
the UK with the majority of winter records being of grounded 
individuals. </p>
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Feeds on medium-sized flying insects such as aquatic flies, 
midges, mosquitoes and caddis flies. </p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>During the summer, females form large maternity colonies of 
up to 350 bats where each gives birth to a single young in 
General
June or early July. For three or four weeks the young are fed 
solely on their mother’s milk. After about four weeks the young 
are able to fly and at six weeks they are able to forage for 
themselves. Occasionally, maternity colonies may temporarily 
move location.</p>
<p>Male bats usually roost alone during the summer. During the 
main mating period from July to early September, males set up 
roosts close to the maternity roost site and spend long periods 
of each night singing social calls from their roosts which are 
thought to be used to attract females for mating.</p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p>Echolocation calls of Nathusius’ pipistrelle are similar to those 
of the other pipistrelles. The peak intensity of the call is lower 
than the other two species, however, at about 38kHz (between 36 
and 40kHz). The social calls are between 20 to 30kHz, audible 
to some adults and children </p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="nathusius_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p>Nathusius’ pipistrelles have been 
widely recorded throughout the 
British Isles but records are sparse. 
Individuals have been recorded on 
North Sea oil platforms, the Shetland 
and Orkney Islands, Jersey and 
Guernsey, the Isle of Wight as well 
as on mainland Britain and Ireland. A 
small number of maternity colonies 
have been found in both Northern 
Ireland and England.</p>
<p>The increase in records in the British Isles in recent years may 
reflect sampling effort, although the possibility that the species 
range is expanding cannot be discounted.</p>
<p>At present, threats to the species would appear to be reduction in 
insect prey due to degradation of water quality, loss of foraging 
habitat such as woodland, treelines and hedgerows plus loss of 
roosting habitat.</p>
