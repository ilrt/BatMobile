    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="brandts.jpg" id="bat-image">
    <p>Brandt's bat is very similar to whiskered bat and the two species were
      only separated in 1970. Both are small species with somewhat shaggy fur -
      the Brandt's bat is slightly larger than the whiskered bat. The two
      species are most reliably separated by differences larger than the
      whiskered bat. The two species are most reliably separated by differences
      in dentition and penis shape. Other distinguishing features are thought to
      include tragus in dentition and penis shape. Other distinguishing features
      are thought to include tragus shape and claw length.</p>

    <h2>General </h2>
    Brandt's bats emerge within half an hour of sunset and probably remain
    active throughout much of the night. They have a rapid and skilful flight,
    flying at a medium height and more often within woodland than the whiskered
    bat. They occasionally pick their prey off foliage and often feed near
    water.
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p> Brandt's bats are regularly found in buildings, though colonies are more
      commonly found in the north and west. They are found in all types of
      houses including some modern ones, but particularly in older buildings
      with stone walls and slate roofs. It is a crevice dweller, often roosting
      until hanging tiles, above soffits, in cavity walls and under ridge tiles.
    </p>
    <p>Droppings frequently accumulate in the roof below the ridge and
      especially below the favoured roost sites, but not particularly at gable
      ends or on chimneys. Colonies of Brandt's and whiskered bats may use
      separate parts of the same roof and may also roost with pipistrelles or
      longeared bats. They do roost in trees and churches, and have been known
      to use bat boxes</p>
    <p>In winter Brandt's bats are regularly found hibernating in caves and
      tunnels, almost always in small numbers - it is uncertain where the
      majority of them hibernate. They often lodge in tight crevices and can be
      found among clusters of other species. Males may stay at the hibernation
      sites until well into May. </p>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    Moths, other small insects and spiders.
    <h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
    <p> Mating usually takes place in autumn, but has been observed in all
      winter months. Adult females form maternity colonies in the summer, giving
      birth to their single young in June or early July. The baby is fed solely
      on its mother's milk: by three weeks it can fly and by six weeks it can
      forage for itself. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Some females reach sexual maturity at three months (in their first
      autumn) but the majority do not mate until their second autumn </p>
    <h2>Echolocation</h2>
    <p> Brandt's bats echolocate between 33kHz and 89kHz, sounding loudest at
      45kHz. Their calls sound like dry clicks (similar to Daubenton's but not
      as regular and often slower); they are sometimes mistaken for pipistrelles
      but their frequency range is much wider.</p>
    <h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
    <p><img alt="distribution" src="brandts_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image"></p>
    <p> Brandt's bat is thought to be slightly less common and widespread than
      the whiskered bat. It is found throughout England and Wales and has only
      recently been recorded in Ireland as well.</p>
    <p>They are vulnerable to the effects of modern agricultural practices and
      decline of woodland, which result in loss of suitable feeding habitats and
      hollow trees for roosting. They are susceptible to pesticides, especially
      those used as remedial timber treatment chemicals. Disturbance and
      vandalism of their hibernation sites (caves and tunnels) is an additional
      threat.</p>
