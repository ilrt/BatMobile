    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img  src="common_pipistrelle.jpg" id="bat-image">
    <p> Pipistrelles are the commonest and most widespread of all British bat species. There are two 
very similar species, common pipistrelle and soprano pipistrelle. Pipistrelles are the bats that 
you are most likely to see. They appear fast and jerky in flight as they dodge about pursuing you are most likely to see. They appear fast and jerky in flight as they dodge about pursuing 
small insects which the bats catch and eat on the wing. A single pipistrelle can consume up to small insects which the bats catch and eat on the wing. A single pipistrelle can consume up to 
3,000 insects in one night! </p>

    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> The two commonest pipistrelle species found in the UK, the 
common and soprano pipistrelle, were only identified as separate 
species in the 1990s. The two species look very similar and often 
the easiest way to tell them apart is from the frequency of their 
echolocation calls. </p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p> Common pipistrelles feed in a wide range of habitats comprising 
woodland, hedgerows, grassland, farmland, suburban and also 
urban areas. They generally emerge from their roost around 20 
minutes after sunset and fly 2-10m above ground level searching 
for their insect prey, which they catch and eat on the wing by 
'aerial hawking'.</p>
    <p>Summer roosts of both common and soprano pipistrelles are
usually found in crevices around the outside of often newer 
buildings, such as behind hanging tiles, soffit and barge or eaves 
boarding, between roofing felt and roof tiles or in cavity walls </p>
    <p>This species also roosts in tree holes and crevices, and also in 
bat boxes. Summer roosts support smaller colonies than soprano 
pipistrelles, with numbers averaging around 75 bats. Common 
pipistrelle maternity colonies are more likely to move between 
roost sites than those of soprano pipistrelles. </p>
<p>In winter common pipistrelles are found singly or in small 
numbers in crevices of buildings and trees, and also in bat boxes. 
They are often found in relatively exposed locations and rarely 
underground.</p>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p> Feeds mainly on a wide range of small flies as well as the aquatic 
midges and mosquitos.</p>
    <h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
    <p>During the summer, females form maternity colonies where they 
give birth to a single young in June or early July. For three or 
four weeks the young are fed solely on their mother’s milk. After 
about four weeks the young are able to fly and at six weeks they 
are able to forage for themselves.</p>
<p>Male bats usually roost singly or in small groups through the
summer months. During the main mating period from July to 
early September, males defend individual territories as mating 
roosts, attracting females by making repeated ‘songflights’ 
around their roost and singing social calls.</p>

    <h2>Echolocation</h2>
    <p> Sounds produced by common pipistrelles are above the range 
of human hearing with the exception of social calls that may be 
heard by children and some adults with good hearing. With a bat 
detector (heterodyne) the echolocation calls can be picked up 
between about 45 and 70kHz.</p>
<p>The calls sound like a series of clicks towards the top of this 
range, turning into ‘wetter’ slaps with the deepest sounding slap 
being heard at about 45kHz, the peak intensity of the call.</p>
    <h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="common_pipistrelle_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
    <p> The common pipistrelle is widely 
distributed across the UK and its 
distribution appears to extend further 
north than that of soprano pipistrelle. 
Along with the common pipistrelle 
it is one of Britain’s commonest bat 
species.</p>
    <p>Populations of pipistrelles have 
declined dramatically in the last 
few decades. This is at least partly 
as a result of modern agricultural 
practices, although common 
pipistrelle populations have started showing signs of recovery 
in recent years. Their reliance on buildings for roosting makes 
them vulnerable to building renovations, exclusion and toxic 
remedial timber treatment chemicals. </p>
