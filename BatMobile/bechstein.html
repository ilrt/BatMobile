    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> Until recently very little was known about the Bechstein's bat in the
      UK- in 2005 there were just six breeding populations of Bechstein's bat.
      It is largely known as a woodland bat that, like the long-eared bats,
      captures much of its prey by passive listening for insect noise.</p>
    <p>Being one of the rarest mammals, much remains to be learned about
      Bechstein's bat. The information contained in this factsheet may change as
      further roosts are discovered and research is undertaken </p>
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p> Deciduous woodland provides most of the habitat for Bechstein's bat - it
      uses woodland for roosting, foraging and almost certainly hibernation.
      Mature dense woodland is ideal, ensuring that Bechstein's do not often
      come into contact with people. </p>
    <p>In summer, Bechstein's bat roosts largely in woodpecker holes, although
      sometimes behind loose bark or in tree crevices (also occasionally in bat
      boxes). It rarely roosts in buildings. It is thought to hibernate in
      similar roosting sites to those it uses in summer, although perhaps in
      slightly deeper tree holes. It is also occasionally found in underground
      sites. </p>
    <p>Bechstein's bats tend to forage in woodland within a kilometre or two of
      their roost site, generally high up in the canopy although they are
      occasionally observed flying nearer the ground, perhaps when drinking,
      commuting or socialising. </p>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p> Bechstein's bat eats prey from most insect groups. Droppings work on the
      Isle of Wight and in Wiltshire shows that it eats dung flies, grasshoppers
      and nut weevils, as well as moths and other types of flies.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> A colony located in an area that has lost of all of its deciduous
      woodland forage has been shown to have a diet that includes non-flying
      insect larvae and spiders that are gleaned from vegetation and near to the
      ground, but this is atypical. </p>
    <h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
    <p> Mating occurs in autumn and spring, with maternity colonies forming in
      April and May. Females gather in colonies of between 10 and 30 bats (and
      up to 100 in some cases), with babies born at the end of June to the
      beginning of July.</p>
    <p> Maternity colonies are often spread across a number of roost sites,
      changing their location frequently throughout the summer. Bechstein's bats
      have been recorded as living up to 21 years.</p>
    <h2>Echolocation</h2>
    <p> The Bechstein's bat has very quiet echolocation , and as a result is
      difficult to detect. The frequency of most energy is 50kHz, and the call
      sounds like 'tik'</p>
    <h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
    <p><img alt="distribution" src="bechstein_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image"></p>

    <p> Very rare, found in southern Wales and parts of southern England. The UK
      is at the nothernmost edge of its distribution range. </p>
    <p>The Bechstein's bat has gone from being one of the commonest UK species
      after the last ice age to one of the rarest, due largely to the
      destruction of ancient woodland that once covered the UK (it now
      represents around 2%). </p>
