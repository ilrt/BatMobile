    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> Natterer’s bats have a slow to medium flight, sometimes over 
water, but more often amongst trees, where their broad wings and 
tail membrane give them great manoeuvrability at slow speed. 
They normally fly at heights of less than 5m, but occasionally 
may reach 15m in the tree canopy. Much of the prey is taken 
from foliage and includes many flightless or day-flying insects. 
Sometimes larger prey is taken to a feeding perch. </p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p>Relatively few summer roost sites are known. However, most 
known summer colonies are in old stone buildings with large 
timber beams, such as castles, manor houses and churches, or 
large old timbered barns. Crevices in beams or gaps in beam 
joints are common roost sites. One colony is known to roost in a 
stone garden wall and two in entrances to mines. They also roost 
under bridges.</p>
    <p>Although colonies are rare in houses, they occur occasionally in 
the roof space or directly under ridge tiles, where they are often 
hidden amongst timber or tiles. Access to roost sites is often by 
direct uninterrupted flight through a permanently open aperture, 
or at the eaves but is sometimes via tortuous routes through 
hollow walls or behind tiles. There are usually a few droppings 
below the access point.</p>
	<p> The emergence of Natterer’s bats from their roost reaches a peak
about one hour after sunset. There is then a lull in activity before 
the bats begin to return. They have been observed returning an 
hour or two before sunrise, but when young are present they may 
do so soon after emergence.</p>
	<p>Natterer’s bats start to arrive at their hibernation sites in December 
with peak numbers in January or early February. Most leave by 
early March. They show a preference for the cool entrance areas 
of caves and mines but will hibernate in any underground shelter. 
Natterer’s bats are one of the species most frequently found in 
any small cave-like site or even exposed rock crevices. They are 
usually solitary, but small groups are not uncommon and may 
include other species. An exceptional cluster of about 150 bats is 
regularly found at one site. </p>
    <p> In their efforts to lodge in small crevices they can be found in
almost any position, including lying on their back or sides, 
or even resting on their heads. Individual Natterer’s bats are 
occasionally found hibernating in churches, in crevices between 
beams</p>
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p> Flies (mainly midges), small</p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>Mating occurs mainly in the autumn, but has been observed in all 
winter months. Maternity colonies of adult females are formed 
from May-June through to July and sometimes until SeptemberOctober. They may change roost sites frequently. The female 
gives birth to a single young at the end of June or in early July. 
For the first 3 weeks the young bat feeds only on its mother’s 
milk and is left in a crèche inside the roost when its mother goes 
out at night to feed. During this time the juvenile may make its 
first flight inside the roost, and within 6 weeks it is fully weaned 
and able to forage for itself.</p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p>The echolocation calls of the Natterer’s bat are very quiet. Their 
frequency range is 35 to 80kHz with a peak at about 50kHz. On 
a bat detector the calls are heard as irregular rapid clicks, with a
sound similar to cellophane being crumpled. </p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="natterers_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p>Natterer’s bats are found throughout 
most of the British Isles. Recent 
records have extended its range in 
Scotland north to the Great Glen 
fault. Generally it is a scarce and 
poorly known species</p>
<p>The UK population of Natterer’s 
bats is of international importance. 
To conserve its summer roosts, 
the conversion of barns should be 
discouraged and the maintenance 
and remedial timber treatment of other older buildings need 
to be carefully monitored. Important wintering sites should be 
protected. Feeding habitat requirements are poorly known.</p>
