    <h2>General </h2>
    <p>Leisler’s bats appear early in the evening, soon after the 
noctule, and have been observed emerging from houses 
at about sunset. They may stay away from the roost until 
dawn. They usually fly high and fast in the open, frequently 
at or below tree top level, with shallow dives. Sometimes 
they fly close to the ground along lanes and well lit roads. 
In suburban areas they may be attracted to insects around 
street lights  </p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p> Leisler’s bat is naturally a forest species, roosting in tree 
holes. Bat boxes have proved in some areas to be a useful 
substitute for natural roost sites. They occasionally share 
roosts with noctules and pipistrelles. They also roost in 
buildings, both old and new. In houses they have been found 
around the gable ends in lofts, between tiles and underfelt, 
under ridge tiles, above large soffit boards, behind hanging 
tiles, under loft floor insulation, behind window shutters 
and in disused chimneys.</p>
    <p>Leisler’s bat is a mobile species and one roost is often 
occupied for only a few days before the colony moves to 
another roost. The bats are very vocal prior to emergence 
and are particularly noisy on hot summer days, producing 
a loud metallic sounding call.</p>
	<p>Leisler’s bats hibernate in tree holes, in the cracks and 
cavities of buildings and occasionally in caves and tunnels. 
Elsewhere in Europe they sometimes hibernate in large 
groups in rock crevices.</p>
    
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Flies, moths, caddis flies, beetles. </p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>Mating occurs from late summer until mid-autumn. 
Breeding males emerge from their holes at dusk and 
slowly fly around calling loudly every second or so. They 
keep within 300 m of their mating roost, returning to the 
roost after several minutes, where they continue to call and 
await the arrival of the females. If no females arrive, the 
males fly around calling again. These calls are audible to 
the human ear and are not like calls used in echolocation. 
The males do not feed during the courtship period. Male 
Leisler’s bats can have a harem of up to nine females; 
males give off a strong sweet odour during the autumn.</p>
<p>In the summer, maternity colonies of females gather in tree 
holes and sometimes in buildings, particularly in Ireland 
where colonies may number 1,000. The young are born 
in mid-June. Usually a single young is born, but twins are 
recorded more frequently in eastern Europe.</p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p> Leisler’s bats echolocation calls range from 15 to 45kHz 
and peak at 25kHz. The calls are occasionally audible to the 
human ear. On a bat detector a characteristic “chip chop” 
with clicks at the top of the range is heard, but the sounds 
are less strident than those made by the noctule bat.</p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="leislers_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p>Leisler’s bat is found throughout 
the British Isles, with the exception 
of northern Scotland. Ireland is a 
stronghold; the species is the third 
most common here.</p>
<p>In view of its rarity in Britain all
known roosts are important and 
special care should be taken of 
roosts in buildings and of wooded 
areas where the species is known 
to occur. Bat boxes have been 
successful in encouraging the species in some areas. The 
internationally important population in Ireland deserves 
special attention.</p>
