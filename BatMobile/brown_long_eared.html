    <p>Brown long-eared bats are medium-sized. The ears are nearly as long as
      the body but not Brown long-eared bats are medium-sized. The ears are
      nearly as long as the body but not always obvious: when at rest they curl
      their ears back like rams horns, or tuck them away completely under their
      wings leaving only the pointed inner lobe of the ear (the tragus) visible.

    <h2>General </h2>
    <p>As well as catching insects in free flight, brown long-eared bats are
      gleaners, often flying slowly amongst foliage, picking insects off leaves
      and bark. Their broad wings and tail allow slow, highly manoeuvrable,
      hovering flight.</p>
    <p>Sometimes they land on the ground to catch insects or to shift them into
      a controllable position in the mouth, and they are even able to take
      insects from lighted windows. Their flight often includes steep dives and
      short glides.</p>
    <p>These bats are known as 'whispering bats' because their echolocation
      sounds are very quiet. They have particularly sensitive low frequency
      hearing and often locate prey from the sounds made by the insect's own
      movements. They may sometimes use vision.</p>
    <p>Small prey is eaten in flight, but larger insects are taken to a 'perch'.
      Regularly used perches, which are frequently inside porches or barns, can
      be recognised by the accumulations of discarded insect remains,
      particularly wings of moths such as yellow underwings.</p>
    <p>Their habit of flying close to the ground, or even landing to tackle
      prey, makes long-eared bats vulnerable to attack by predators.</p>
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p>Summer roosts are usually located in older buildings, barns, churches and
      trees. Long-eared bats generally form small and quiet colonies of about 20
      animals - often the first a householder knows about them is when a visit
      to the loft reveals a cluster of tiny faces peering down from a corner of
      the rafters!</p>
    <p>Winter roosts tend to be found in caves, tunnels, mines, icehouses and
      occasionally even trees and buildings. Their foraging habitat is open
      deciduous and coniferous woodland, parkland and orchards.</p>
    <p>Unlike the males of other species, a significant proportion of male brown
      long-eared bats may be present in the maternity roosts.</p>
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    Moths, beetles, flies, earwigs and spiders.
    <h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
    <p> Mating takes place in the autumn and active males will continue to seek
      out and mate with females throughout the winter </p>
    <p>Matenity colonies are established in late spring, with one young born
      around late June to mid-July, and then weaned at 6 weeks.</p>
    <p>Colony size is between 10 to 20 bats (up to 50), and each brown
      long-eared can live for up to 30 years.</p>
    <h2>Echolocation</h2>
    <p>Brown long-eared bats echolocation calls range from 25 - 50kHz and peak
      at 35kHz. </p>
    <p>On a bat detector the calls are very quiet and are heard as a series of
      clicks rather like those produced by a Geiger counter.</p>
    <h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
    <p><img alt="distribution" src="brown_long_eared_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image"></p>
    <p>The Brown Long-eared bat is found throughout the UK, Ireland and the Isle
      of Man. It is absent from Orkney and Shetland, and other exposed islands.
      It is also common and widespread in the rest of Europe, except for
      southern Spain, southern Italy and Greece.</p>
    <p>It has declined in Britain due to changing land use, including modern
      intensive agricultural practices, and the conversion of barns
      which have resulted in the loss of suitable feeding and roosting habitats.
      It is particularly susceptible to pesticides, especially their use in
      roofs where it often roosts on exposed timbers. </p>
