<h1>About BatMobile</h1>
<p>
BatMobile is a Jisc funded Nature Locator (University of Bristol) pilot project

to investigate the feasibility of producing a smartphone app capable of

automatically identifying European bat species from their calls.  Both the

Zoological Society of London and the Bat Conservation Trust were partners on

the project.
</p>
<p>

The study uses call recognition code from the open source project <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/batbioacoustics/">Bat BioAcoustics</a> and

demonstrated that the technology is capable of processing the data and

determining bat ID to genus or species level (dependent on the species in

question* and the quality of the detection algorithm).<p>

<p>*Some bat species have such similar calls that separation via calls alone is rarely

possible.</p>
<p>

Stage two of the project would seek to include the audio capture element into the

workflow and increase the accuracy of the bat identification algorithms, whilst

refining the user interface.
