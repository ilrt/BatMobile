    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img  src="soprano.jpg" id="bat-image">
    <p>Pipistrelles are the commonest and most widespread of all British bat species. There are two 
very similar species, common pipistrelle and soprano pipistrelle. Pipistrelles are the bats that 
you are most likely to see. They appear fast and jerky in flight as they dodge about pursuing you are most likely to see. They appear fast and jerky in flight as they dodge about pursuing 
small insects which the bats catch and eat on the wing. A single pipistrelle can consume up to small insects which the bats catch and eat on the wing. A single pipistrelle can consume up to 
3,000 insects in one night! 	</p>

    <h2>General </h2>
    <p> The two commonest pipistrelle species found in the UK, the 
common and soprano pipistrelle, were only identified as separate 
species in the 1990s. The two species look very similar and often 
the easiest way to tell them apart is from the frequency of their 
echolocation calls.  </p>
   
    <h2>Habitats</h2>
    <p> Soprano pipistrelles usually feed in wetland habitats, for example 
over lakes and rivers, and also around woodland edge, tree lines 
or hedgerows, and in suburban gardens and parks.  </p>
    <p>  They generally emerge from their roost around 20 minutes after
sunset and fly 2-10m above ground level searching for their insect 
prey, which they catch and eat on the wing by ‘aerial hawking’. 
Soprano pipistrelles appear to be more selective in their habitat 
use than the more generalist common pipistrelle. </p>
	<p>  Summer roosts of both common and soprano pipistrelles are
usually found in crevices around the outside of often newer 
buildings, such as behind hanging tiles, soffit and barge or eaves 
boarding, between roofing felt and roof tiles or in cavity walls </p>
    <p>  This species also roosts in tree holes and crevices, and also in bat 
boxes. Summer roosts support colonies of an average size of 200 
bats, but they can be even larger with numbers reaching several 
hundred to over a thousand bats </p>
    <p> In winter soprano pipistrelles are found singly or in small 
numbers in crevices of buildings and trees, and also in bat boxes. 
They are often found in relatively exposed locations and rarely 
underground.  </p>
    
	
<h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Feeds mainly on small flies, particularly midges and mosquitoes 
that are associated with water </p>


<h2>Reproduction &amp; life cycle</h2>
<p>During the summer, females form maternity colonies where they 
give birth to a single young in June or early July. For three or 
four weeks the young are fed solely on their mother’s milk</p>
<p>After about four weeks the young are able to fly and at six weeks 
they are able to forage for themselves. </p>
<p>Male bats usually roost singly or in small groups through the
summer months. During the main mating period from July to 
early September, males defend individual territories as mating 
roosts, attracting females by making repeated ‘songflights’ 
around their roost and singing social calls. </p>

<h2>Echolocation</h2>
<p>Sounds produced by soprano pipistrelles are above the range of 
human hearing with the exception of social calls that may be 
heard by children and some adults with good hearing. 
</p>
<p>With a bat detector (heterodyne) the echolocation calls can be 
picked up between about 55 and 80kHz. The calls sound like a 
series of clicks towards the top of this range, turning into ‘wetter’ 
slaps with the deepest sounding slap being heard at about 55kHz, 
the peak intensity of the call. </p>

<h2>Distribution &amp; conservation </h2>
	 <img alt="distribution" src="soprano_distribution.jpg" id="distribution-image">
<p>The soprano pipistrelle is widely 
distributed across the UK, with the 
exception of the very northern parts 
of Scotland. Along with the common 
pipistrelle it is one of Britain’s 
commonest bat species</p>
<p>Populations of pipistrelles have 
declined in the last few decades. This 
is at least partly as a result of modern 
agricultural practices. Their reliance 
on buildings for roosting makes them 
vulnerable to building renovations, exclusion and toxic remedial 
timber treatment chemicals</p>
